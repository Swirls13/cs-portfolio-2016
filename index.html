        <p><em>About me</em></p>
        <p id="border1">My name is Ariel Lee, and I'm a sophomore here at Summit Shasta. Though I'm not in any of the school sport teams, I’ve done a lot of sports such as ice skating, swimming, rollerblading, softball, and volleyball. I find ice skating, rollerblading, and swimming to be fun activites to do. I know enough about them to be able to do them without looking stupid. However, I was never really into softball, and quit in the middle of the season. Volleyball, on the other hand, is a sport I’ve been playing since 4th grade. I eventually stopped after 8th grade, but I still enjoy doing it every once in awhile. Since I stopped doing sports, I’ve found other activities to do. I usually waste my time watching anime or tv shows, though.</p>
        <p id="border1">Something fun I like to do is baking. I like baking because I like to eat what I made lol. It’s also really fun seeing how the dessert turned out and finding out if it tastes good. My favorite things to bake are cookie bowls, fudge brownies, and macaroons. Sometimes when I bake, I like to add decorations to it to make it look nicer. It sucks sometimes when I decorate something nicely and I have to eat it :( My goal is to one day decorate a nice cake.My name is Ariel Lee, and I’m a sophomore here at Summit Shasta.

        <p id="border1">A big hobby of mine is drawing. I've always enjoyed doing it ever since I was little, but I really got into it in 7th grade. Ever since then, I’ve been working to improve my art skills. I try to expand my horizons by trying out new art styles or different kinds of art materials. I’ve tried out different types of materials such as colored pencils (prisma colored pencils), markers (copics), watercolors, outlining pens, and pencils. I hope to try out other materials, like charcoal or oil pastels.</p>
