    <p>My name is Ariel Lee, and I'm a sophomore here at Summit Shasta. Though I'm not in any of the school sport teams, I've done a lot of sports such as ice skating, swimming, rollerblading, softball, and volleyball. Out of all the sports I've played, Volleyball was the longest, so it plays a more significant role in my life. I eventually stopped after 8th grade, but I still enjoy doing it every once in awhile. Since I stopped doing sports, I've found other activities to do. A lot of the time, though, I like to  waste my time watching anime or tv shows.</p>

    <p>Something fun I like to do is baking. I like baking because I like to eat what I make. It's also really fun seeing how the dessert turned out and finding out if it tastes good. My favorite things to bake are cookie bowls, fudge brownies, and macaroons. Sometimes when I bake, I like to add decorations to it to make it look nicer. It sucks sometimes when I decorate something nicely and I have to eat it :( My goal is to one day decorate a nice cake.</p>

    <p>A big hobby of mine is drawing. I've always enjoyed doing it ever since I was little, but I really got into it in 7th grade. Ever since then, I’ve been working to improve my art skills. I try to expand my horizons by trying out new art styles or different kinds of art materials. I’ve tried out different types of materials such as colored pencils (prisma colored pencils), markers (copics), watercolors, outlining pens, and pencils. I hope to try out other materials, like charcoal or oil pastels.</p>
