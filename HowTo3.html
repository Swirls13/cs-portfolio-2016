        <h1 class="writing">How To: Big Project</h1>
        
        <p class="writing">In this How To, you will learn how to make a simple image generator for your website. Like all the other previous How To pages, you need the basic HTML structure.</p>
        <p class="writing">Afterwards, you start out by making buttons. My code of the buttons are below:</p>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot1.png">
        </div>
        
        <li class="writing">For the code, you need to put an input tag.</li>
        <li class="writing">The "type" in the tag tells the program that the input is a button.</li>
        <li class="writing">The "value" in the tag gives the button a label/name. In my case, I named my buttons "Shower Thoughts", "Puns", and "Surprise Me"</li>
        <li class="writing">The last thing is the "id". It's important to give each button it's own id tag because each will be programmed a little different later on.</li>
        
        <p class="writing">When making the buttons, I decided to make the buttons more presentable by putting the code in a "div", and by using CSS, I was able to make the code move to the middle. An example of my code is below:</p>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot2.png">
        </div>
        
        <p class="writing">I also used CSS to make the buttons look more appealing:</p>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot3.png">
        </div>
        
        <p class="writing">(Although it only shows 2 of the buttons, I did it for all three)</p>
        
        <p class="writing">The result of the buttons looked like this:</p>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot4.png">
        </div>
        
        <p class="wrting">The next step is to make do the javascript. In the javascript you need to gather your elements by using "var". What I did is shown below:</p>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot5.png">
        </div>
        
        <p class="writing">As mentioned in my previous How To page,</p>
        
        <li class="writing">The “var” (variable) is used to store the data values into javascript</li>
        <li class="writing">The var has to then be followed by identifiers, which have to be unique to each other to prevent the variables from doing the same function</li>
        <li class="writing">My variables are button1, button2, button3, and display</li>
        <li class="writing">The “=” of the code is usually known as the assignment operator, which assigns the value to the variable</li>
        <li class="writing">document.getElementById(“ “) can be used to get information from another file. For this function, we’re using the ids we made earlier</li>
        
        <p class="writing">After that, we have to add an "addEventListener". This helps make the buttons generate when needed. My code looks like this:</p>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot6.png">
        </div>
        
        <p class="writing">The "click" is there to make the button do soemthing when clicked on. In this case, the button will "generate" when clicked on.</p>
        
        <p class="writing">The next step of the javascript is to insert a few more elements.</p>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot7.png">
        </div>
        
        <li class="writing">In this we use "var" again to store the data. </li>
        <li class="writing">To start out, you need to name each of the images you'll be using. For easier organization, I named the images I'll be using for the first first button "ST" and added numbers behind them. Because we're using images, you'll need the links for the images you'll be using.</li>
        <li class="writing">After naming the pictures individually and linking them to their images, you'll have to find a way to organize all the links together so that they can be randomized later</li>
        <p class="writing">To organize it, here's my code:</p>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot8.png">
        </div>
        
        <p class="writing">By giving this new var a different name, you organize the all the links together so the program has an easeir time randomizing it.</p>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot9.png">
        </div>
        
        <p class="writing">The "function" is used to make the website generate. The variables below it are what tell the program how to randomize it. By using the first variable "randomNum", you are able to tell the program how to randomize the images. In the second variable I had to named it something similar to the the images, so I called it "randomST". After that I had to include the variable "pictures" so that it knows where to get the images from.</p>
        <p class="writing">After all of that, it's important to add in "display.innerHTML = randomST;" so when it picks an image, it will show up on the page.</p>
        
        <p class="writing">Afterwards, I continued to do the same for the rest of the buttons, only changing the links, variable names, and function names. My code for all the buttons are below:</p>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot10.png">
        </div>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot11.png">
        </div>
        
        <div class="imagething">
        <img src="images3/shot12.png">
        </div>
        
        </div>
        </div>
